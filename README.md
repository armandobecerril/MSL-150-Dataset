# MSL-150: Mexican Sign Language (MSL) Keypoint Dataset for Domain-Specific Vocabulary

MSL-150 is a public keypoint-only dataset of 150 Mexican Sign Language (MSL) signs,
processed with MediaPipe Holistic and curated for reproducible research in:

- Sign language recognition
- Keypoint-based gesture modeling
- Sequential and grammar-level sign interpretation

This dataset forms part of the research:  
**“Recurrent Neural Networks for the Interpretation of Mexican Sign Language in Domain-Specific Communication Scenarios.”**
